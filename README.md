# Basic Hitcounter

A currently EXTREMELY basic hitcounter built with Flask. Simply stores the current hitcount in a binary file, updating it whenever the counter is accessed.

There is currently no support for multiple-host usage of the hitcounter, or only logging "unique" client-based hits, but these are both planned.
